### Abnormal Gait Pattern Analysis
The project involved analyzing a diverse range of abnormal gait patterns, including:

- **Antalgic Gait**: Compensation patterns due to pain
- **Ataxic Gait**: Unsteady, uncoordinated walking patterns
- **Hemiplegic Gait**: Patterns resulting from stroke or brain injury
- **Parkinsonian Gait**: Characteristic shuffling and reduced arm swing
- **Trendelenburg Gait**: Hip drop due to gluteal weakness

### Clinical Database
We utilized an extensive **in-house database of human participants** featuring:
- Diverse patient populations
- Various severity levels of gait abnormalities
- Multiple walking conditions and environments
- Longitudinal data for tracking progression
