## Research Statement Summary

My research focuses on developing robust and efficient deep learning models that can learn meaningful representations with minimal supervision. I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between computer vision and other modalities through self-supervised learning approaches. My long-term goal is to create AI systems that can understand and interact with the world through multiple sensory inputs, with applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction.
