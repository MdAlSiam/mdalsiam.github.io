I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Tuskegee University, pursuing an MSc in Electrical Engineering with a focus on **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence**. My research interests span **Self-Supervised Learning**, **Computer Vision Architectures**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **AI in Healthcare**.

Currently, I'm working on **Representation Learning** applications in Computer Vision, collaborating with the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial and Natural Intelligence](https://arni-institute.org/), advised by [Dr. Dewan Fahim Noor](https://www.tuskegee.edu/programs-courses/colleges-schools/coe/electrical-engineering/ee-faculty-staff/dewan-noor). My work aims to advance the field of self-supervised learning for practical computer vision applications.

## research interests

- **Computer Vision**: Image processing, object detection, pose estimation
- **Machine Learning**: Self-supervised learning, deep learning architectures, vision-language models
- **AI in Healthcare**: Gait analysis, musculoskeletal pattern recognition
<!-- - **Natural Language Processing**: Language model training and optimization -->
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Air-writing recognition, gesture-based interfaces

## background

With a strong foundation in both theoretical research and practical software development, I have experience spanning from academic research to industry applications. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh, focusing on calm technology and AI applications. I also served as a Lecturer at Northern University Bangladesh, where I taught computer science courses and mentored competitive programming teams.

## technical expertise

- **Programming**: Python, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, state-of-the-art pose estimation models
- **Web Development**: Django REST Framework, ASP.NET, AngularJS
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3), Azure
- **Tools**: Git, Postman, Jira, LaTeX
