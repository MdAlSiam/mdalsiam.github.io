I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Tuskegee University, pursuing an MSc in Electrical Engineering with a focus on **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

Currently, I'm working on **Representation Learning** applications in **Computer Vision**, collaborating with the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial and Natural Intelligence](https://arni-institute.org/), advised by [Dr. Dewan Fahim Noor](https://www.tuskegee.edu/programs-courses/colleges-schools/coe/electrical-engineering/ee-faculty-staff/dewan-noor). My work aims to advance the field of self-supervised learning for practical computer vision applications.

I earned a **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering** from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology where I worked with [Prof. Dr. Md Al Mehedi Hasan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kMspjFIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Abu Sayeed](https://www.cse.ruet.ac.bd/abusayeedcse), and [Prof. Dr. Jungpil Shin](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/is-pp/pplab/shin.html) (University of Aizu, Japan). My junior and senior year thesis and internships focused on **developong efficient DL models for gesture and gait recognition**.

With a strong foundation in both theoretical research and practical software development, I have experience spanning from academic research to industry applications. Previously, I served as a Lecturer at [Northern University Bangladesh](https://nub.ac.bd/), where I taught computer science courses and coached competitive programming teams. I also worked as a Software Engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd), focusing on AI-powered calm technology R&D, and at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/), where my role focused on developing full-stack business-scale web applications.
